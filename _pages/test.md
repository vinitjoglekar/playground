# What is programming?

<div class="synopsis">
  <h3> A Plain English Explanation </h3>
</div>

If a genie appears before you and grants you 3 wishes, what would you ask? 

Take a minute to think about it, and then read on.

This is what I would ask:
- Wish #1 - Please grant me 1000 wishes. <div class="synopsis"> Now I have 1002 wishes remaining. </div>
- Wish #2 - Please keep track of my remaining wishes. <div class="synopsis"> Now I have 1001 wishes remaining, and the genie will keep track of the number for me. </div>
- Wish #3 - Whenever the number of remaining wishes becomes less than 100, please ask from yourself, for and on my behalf, to grant me 1000 wishes. 

<div class="synopsis"> Voila! I now have an auto-recharge facility set up with the genie! </div>


And that is what programming is!

**Programming is the art of exploiting any entity which can take and obey instructions.** So you can program genies, humans, animals, and computers too. Legal contracts, or even the law itself, is an attempt to program human behavior. Influencing a person is a softer attempt to achieve the same end. The good (and the bad) thing about a computer is that it always obeys the instructions - nothing more, and nothing less! It won't attempt to find a loophole in the given instructions, nor will it fill in for the upspoken intentions. This deterministic behavior is what makes a computer reliable, and at the same time creates space for a profession called "programmer" - a person whose job is to draft exhaustive instructions with nothing left unsaid.

Done again.
